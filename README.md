# Currency-Conversion
Python Program that converts an amount from one currency to another

Investopedia (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencypair.asp#:~:text=A%20currency%20pair%20is%20the,is%20called%20the%20quote%20currency)  defines a currency pair as a quotation of two different curriencies with value of one currency (Base Currency) being quoted against the other (Quoted Currency).

In a curency pair the first currency is the base and the second is the quoted. The pair is represented as BaseQuoted=X which interpretes as 1 Base Currency is equal to X Quoted Currency. for example, a quote of USDZMW=15.65 means that USD1 is equal to ZMW15.65.

We will develope a program that will allow a user to enter an amount to be converted from one currency to another and also provide a historical visualisation of the performance of the selected currency pair over a one month period.
